# Introduction

Longitude and latitude are great measures to obtain relatively precise locations of the observations, but oftentimes these coordinates alone do not tell enough stories.
How can we easily convert these measures to something more meaningful?<br>

## GEOPY

Geopy is a Python client for several popular geocoding web services.Geopy makes it easy for Python developers to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks 
across the globe using third-party geocoders and other data sources.<br>

<br>Geopy includes geocoder classes for the OpenStreetMap Nominatim, Google Geocoding API (V3), and many other geocoding services.
The full list is available on the Geocoders doc section. Geocoder classes are located in geopy.geocoders.<br>

<br>We can do many things with these coordinates using the Geopy library. Geopy can calculate the distance between different points,
it can also make an API call on our behalf to get information about these coordinates.<br>
